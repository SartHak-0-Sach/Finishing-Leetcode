Intuition
The problem requires converting a given string into a zigzag pattern with a specified number of rows and then reading the characters row by row to form a resulting string. The zigzag pattern involves characters moving diagonally up and down.

Approach
Special Cases:
If the number of rows (numRows) is 1 or greater than or equal to the length of the input string (s.length()), return the input string as it is, as there is no zigzag pattern to form.
Initialize variables:
Create an empty string result to store the resulting zigzag pattern.
Find the length of the input string n.
Calculate the cycle length cycleLen as 2 * numRows - 2. This represents the number of characters in each complete cycle of the zigzag pattern.
Iterate through each row (from 0 to numRows - 1):
Inside the outer loop, iterate through the characters of the input string with a step size of cycleLen.
In each iteration, append the character at index j + i to the result, where j is the current position within the cycle and i is the current row.
If the current row is not the first row (i.e., i != 0) and not the last row (i.e., i != numRows - 1), and there is a valid character at the index j + cycleLen - i, append that character as well. This accounts for the diagonal movement in the zigzag pattern.
After completing both loops, the result string will contain the zigzag pattern.

Return the result string as the final output.

Complexity
Time complexity:
The code iterates through the input string s once, performing constant-time operations within the loops.
Therefore, the time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s.
Space complexity:
The space complexity mainly depends on the additional space used to store the result string.
In the worst case, the result string can have the same length as the input string, so the space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s.
The space used for other variables is constant and does not significantly impact the space complexity.
