We can do this question in O(N) TC O(1) SC by declaring a constant size visited array whose value will be updated by i as we traverse through the string. To see if the character has been there before or not we will constantly update the characters appearing with i so that as soon as the character appears again, its value will be more than start and the start variable will be updated thus giving us the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
