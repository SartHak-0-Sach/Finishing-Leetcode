Approach ( 2 Pointer )
1. Since the original array is not sorted, it's not guaranteed 
    that the largest elements (in terms of absolute value) 
    are at the ends of the array.

1. By iterating backwards from the end of the array, we can 
    start populating the result array from the end, ensuring 
    that the squares of larger elements occupy the higher 
    indices of the result array.
