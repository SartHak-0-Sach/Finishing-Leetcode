Substring
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. It can start at any position and end at any position in the string, as long as the sequence is uninterrupted.

Example:
For the string "abcdef", some substrings are "abc", "cde", "ef", "abcd", etc.
Note that substrings must be contiguous.
Prefix
A prefix is a special type of substring that starts at the beginning of the string and includes any number of characters up to the entire string.

Example:
For the string "abcdef", some prefixes are "a", "ab", "abc", "abcd", "abcde", and "abcdef".
Subsequence
A subsequence is a sequence derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. The characters are not required to be contiguous.

Example:
For the string "abcdef", some subsequences are "abc", "ace", "bdf", "a", "af", "abcdef", etc.
Note that unlike substrings, subsequences do not have to be contiguous.
Summary of Differences
Substring: A contiguous part of a string.

Example: "abc" is a substring of "abcdef".
Prefix: A substring that starts at the beginning of a string.

Example: "abc" is a prefix of "abcdef", but "bcd" is not.
Subsequence: A sequence that can be derived from a string by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

Example: "ace" is a subsequence of "abcdef", but "cae" is not (since it changes the order).
Visual Example
Consider the string "abcdef":

Substrings:

"abc", "bcd", "cde", "def", "abcd", etc.
Prefixes:

"a", "ab", "abc", "abcd", "abcde", "abcdef"
Subsequences:

"a", "b", "ab", "ace", "bdf", "acf", "abcdef", etc.

This is the difference between substring prefix and subsequence

Solved this question in O(N^2) TC by taking a common prefix between strs[0] and strs[1] and then subsequently comparing it with all other strings to reduce it and return final result at end in O(1) SC.
